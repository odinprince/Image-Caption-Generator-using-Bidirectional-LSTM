# Image Caption Generator
## Overview
This project involves building an Image Caption Generator that automatically generates a descriptive caption for a given image. The model is built using a Bidirectional LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network integrated with Attention Mechanism to effectively learn the relationship between images and captions.The model has been implemented using PyTorch and trained on a dataset of images and corresponding captions, producing captions that are both coherent and contextually relevant.

## Features
#### Generates captions for images using deep learning techniques.
#### Incorporates Bidirectional LSTM for improved context capture in both directions (forward and backward).
#### Uses Attention Mechanism to focus on specific parts of the image during caption generation, improving caption relevance.
#### Built with PyTorch, leveraging GPU for faster training and inference.
